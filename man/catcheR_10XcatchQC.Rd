catcheR_10XcatchQC(
  group = c("docker", "sudo"),
  folder,
  reference = "GGCGCGTTCATCTGGGGGAGCCG",
  mode = "bimodal",
  samples = 1,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{group, }{a character string. Two options: sudo or docker, depending to which group the user belongs}

\item{folder, }{a character string indicating the path of the working folder containing the input files}

\item{reference, }{a character string indicating the sequence to identify reads containing barcodes. Should be found at at the beginning of read2. Use reverse complement!}

\item{mode, }{a character string. Two options: "bimodal" or "noise". To evaluate a threshold number of UMIs to consider a UCI valid there are 2 options: "bimodal" (default) which sets the threshold at the valley of the UMIxUCI distribution, or "noise", which sets the threshold at 1.35 * number of UCI supported by a single UMI.}

\item{samples, }{integer indicating the number of different samples present in the sample (aggregated with cell ranger aggr)}

\item{x, }{an integer indicating the x limit to zoom the UMIxUCI plot. Default is 100}

\item{y, }{an integer indicating the y limit to zoom the UMIxUCI plot. Default is 400}
