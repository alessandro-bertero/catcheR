catcheR_design(
  group = c("docker", "sudo"),

}
\arguments{
\item{group, }{a character string. Two options: sudo or docker, depending to which group the user belongs}

\item{folder, }{a character string indicating the path of the working folder containing the input files}

\item{sequences, }{a character string indicating the filename of the csv file containing sequences of interest and corresponding barcodes}

\item{gibson.five, }{a character string indicating the sequence of the gibson overhang to put before the shRNA, at the beginning of the construct}

\item{gibson.three, }{a character string indicating the sequence of the gibson overhang to put at the end of the construct}

\item{fixed, }{a character string indicating the fixed sequence to put after the shRNA in the contruct, between poly T and UCI}

\item{restriction.sites, }{a character string indicating the filename of the txt file containing sequences of the restriction sites to avoid in the sequence}
}
\value{
a file called "output.txt" containing the sequences of the constructs. Restriction sites are in lower case.
